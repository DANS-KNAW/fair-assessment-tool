                    <br>
                    <p>Welcome to the DANS FAIR Data self-assessment tool. Using this tool you will be able to assess
                        the 'FAIRness' of a dataset and determine how to enhance its FAIRness (where applicable).</p>
                    <p>
                    This self-assessment tool has been designed predominantly for data librarians and IT staff, but could be used
                    by software engineers developing FAIR Data tools and services, and researchers provided they have assistance
                    from research support staff.</p>
                    <p>
                    You will be asked questions related to the principles underpinning Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
                    Reusable. Once you have answered all the questions in each section you will be given a ‘green bar’ indicator based
                    on your answers in that section, and when all sections are completed, an overall 'FAIRness' indicator is provided.</p>
                    <p>
                    Please be aware that additional explanatory information is provided within the tool. The (i) information button
                    provides an overview of each of the FAIR high-level elements (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).
                    Additionally, each question is hyperlinked, leading users to explanatory information and links to wider resources
                    on related topics.

<!-- ======================================= Findable  ======================================= -->

<div id="F-i-contents">
    Now that you have finished your research project, you are on the brink of depositing your research data in a trustworthy long-term repository. Findability is one of the four pillars of the
    <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR Guiding Principles</a>. If you take care of the findability of your data, you will enable search engines to find it and possibly also link it to related sources on the web.
    Moreover, you will improve the exposure of your research and help researchers to find and potentially reuse your data.
    <br><br>
    Findability generally comes down to giving a proper description of your dataset.
    This description can be divided into three elements:
    <ul>
        <li>Rich and detailed metadata and additional information</li>

<div id="F-i-1-contents">
    Metadata is information that describes an object such as a dataset. It gives context to the research data, providing information about the URL where the dataset is stored, creator, provenance, purpose, time, geographic locations, access conditions, and terms of use of a data collection.
    The extent to which metadata is given for a dataset can vary greatly and has an effect on how findable a dataset is.
    In EASY a minimum number of metadata fields are required in order to successfully deposit a dataset. The minimum metadata, however, is not comprehensive enough to fulfil the requirements of FAIR.
    The following list provides a comprehensive list of items that should be covered when aiming for sufficient metadata:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>A globally unique <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971013-What-are-persistent-identifiers-PIDs-" target="_blank">Persistent Identifier</a> (PID) e.g. a DOI (provided by EASY)</li>
        <li>A title</li>
        <li>Related people, i.e. the creator of the dataset</li>
        <li>Other related people who contributed to the dataset</li>
        <li>Date on which the dataset was completed</li>
        <li>A description of how the data were created (contextual information)</li>
        <li>Target group for the dataset deposited (i.e. scientific disciplines)</li>
        <li>Keywords that describe your data (use controlled vocabularies if available for your field)</li>
        <li>A licence that clearly states the extent to which the data is accessible (a list to choose from is given in EASY)</li>
        <li>Temporal coverage: the period of time to which the data relate</li>
        <li>Spatial coverage: Geographical location of the research area or site</li>
        <li>Related datasets, resources like publications, websites etc. (digital or analogue)</li>
        <li>File formats used in the dataset</li>
    </ul>

    ! Many of the items on this list also relate to the accessibility, interoperability and reusability of the dataset. These aspects will be dealt with in the respective sections of this tool.

<div id="F-i-2-contents">
    To make your (meta)data findable we encourage the use of controlled vocabularies, taxonomies and/or ontologies.
    <br><br>
    A <b>controlled vocabulary</b> is an organized and standardized list of terms and can be used to describe data. Controlled vocabularies are mostly discipline-specific and therefore very useful for describing your data.
    By using controlled vocabularies your metadata becomes much more understandable for machines and users and therefore they improve the findability of your data.
    <br><br>
    A <b>taxonomy</b> is a classification of entities in an ordered system. A taxonomy is mostly domain specific and is used to identify the content/data by adding terms from the taxonomy to the content/data description.
    Identifying content in a structured way gives search engines the opportunity to optimize their search functionality. In this way more relevant data can be found based on a single search query.
    Therefore adding taxonomy terms to your dataset description the findability of your dataset will improve.
    <br><br>
    An <b>ontology</b> is a formal description of knowledge. This knowledge is described as a set of concepts and relations between these concepts within a specific domain.
    Ontologies are created to organize information into data and knowledge. An ontology attempts to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories.
    By applying existing ontologies to describe your data, your data becomes more understandable for machines and thus improves the findability of  your data.
    From ontologies it is a small step to <b>linked open data</b>. Making use of linked open data means that your data is interlinked with other data, that your data is openly accessible and that your data can be shared within the semantic web.
    In this way your data is published in a structured and understandable way. Linked (open) data is described as a set of triples;  following the RDF data structure.  triple is a basic set of a subject, a predicate and an object.
    For example, a subject is “grass”, its corresponding predicate “has color” and the object is “green”. By linking your data to other data, more knowledge and information and links to your data becomes available.
    This will help to increase the findability of your data.
    <br><br>
    It is true that standardized controlled vocabularies, taxonomies or ontologies are not equally developed in the disciplines. For some disciplines a broad range of standards are available whilst others have none yet.
    There are, however, general standards, such as the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/" target="_blank">Getty Thesaurus</a> for geographical names, which can be used across disciplines.
    <br><br>
    In EASY some metadata sections already offer (domain specific) controlled vocabularies. For instance, to describe the subject and the temporal coverage  you can select term from the “Archeologisch Basis Register” (ABR) and the newer version ABRplus.
    These vocabularies are maintained by the Dutch “Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed”
    <br><br>
    For the ones among you who are interested in more technical background information: The EASY/DANS datavault  offers standardised terms for creator and contributor, these are derived
    from <a href="http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.0/include/datacite-contributorType-v4.xsd" target="_blank">DataCite</a>. To specify a Relation the standard specification of
    <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/usageguide/qualifiers/" target="_blank">Dublin Core</a> is used.
    For language the ISO 639 standard is used and for date fields the ISO 8601 standard is used.
    And to specify the format of the dataset you can make use of <a href="https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-split-multi-deposit/blob/master/src/main/assembly/dist/cfg/acceptedMediaTypes.txt" target="_blank">this</a> standardised list.

    Additional information is information that helps users to assess the content and the relevance of the dataset they are viewing. The most important means to provide additional information is a so-called readme file in which topics like the structure of the dataset are addressed.
    Questions like how many files does the dataset contain and how are they related to each other? Which software has to be used to assess the data? How many versions of data are contained in the dataset? Help users to assess and contextualize the dataset.
    Other topics to address include but are by no means limited to methodologies used, a detailed summary of the project in which the data was collected, information about whether and how the data was cleaned, how many versions of the dataset were made etc.
    Information about the provenance and the versioning of your data, moreover, can be added in addition to the readme file.
    If you have covered most of the items on the metadata list (see explanatory text Question 1) you already provide a satisfactory amount of additional information. Nevertheless, it is important to supplement your metadata with more contextual information.

<!-- ======================================= Accessible  ======================================= -->

<div id="A-i-contents">
    <p>
        The accessibility of a dataset and its corresponding metadata is essential for researchers to assess and potentially reuse a dataset.
        The questions that you will find under accessibility concern the accessibility of the metadata over time, meaning that the repository guarantees that the metadata will be available even if the data itself is no longer available, and the usage license chosen for the dataset.
        The latter determines to what extent or under which circumstances the dataset can be accessed. EASY has a number of usage licenses from which to choose, depending on the content of the data.
        In the FAIR Principles, the automated accessibility of metadata and data by machines is also covered under Accessibility.
        As EASY makes use of the <a href="https://dublincore.org/resources/metadata-basics/" target="_blank">Dublin Core</a> metadata schema and provides a President Identifier (see Findability) for each dataset, the machine actionability of the metadata is covered.
        There is no question about this technical aspect in this part.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="A-i-1-contents">
    Metadata as described in Question 1 is the description of your data. As such it is associated with your dataset. For the accessibility but also for the findability of your data it is essential that the metadata of the dataset remains accessible even if the data itself is not available anymore. It is the repository you deposit in, in our case EASY, which should ensure that this is the case.
    With this question we would like to encourage you to check whether the metadata in EASY is publicly accessible even if the dataset is no longer available.
</div>

<div id="A-i-2-contents">
    The extent to which you can make your dataset openly available depends on whether your dataset contains personal data. If it contains personal data, it is clear that you will have to restrict the access to your dataset. In question six  you can further specify which usage license you intend to choose.
    In the explanatory text of Question six, the different usage licenses provided by EASY are listed.
</div>

<div id="A-i-3-contents">
    On the EASY page where detailed information is provided about how the data should be deposited (“During depositing”), there is a list with licenses that you can choose from. Depending on the data and on whether or not the data contains personal data (see question 5) you can choose:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Open Access (everyone): CC0 Waver, accessible to everyone, no login in EASY required. Choose this license if your dataset doesn’t contain personal data and if you are allowed to publish it openly.</li>
        <li>Open Access (registered users): accessible to registered users in accordance with the General Conditions of Use. Choose this license if your data doesn’t contain personal data but you would like users to identify themselves before downloading your data. </li>
        <li>Restricted Access (request permission): with your prior consent, users can view and download data in accordance with the General Conditions of Use. You can also impose additional conditions. Choose this license if your data contains personal data.</li>
        <li>Restricted Access (archaeology group): accessible to registered archaeologists and archaeology students in accordance with the General Conditions of Use. Choose this license if you are in the field of archeology.</li>

    You have chosen the right license if your dataset doesn't contain personal data. Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data. Personal data that has been rendered anonymous in such a way that the individual is not or no longer identifiable is no longer considered personal data. For data to be truly anonymised, the anonymisation must be irreversible.

<div id="A-advice-3.1">
    You have chosen the right license if your data contains personal data which can only be accessed after individual approval. Chosing this usage license however means that your dataset won't be openly accessible. Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable living individual. Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data. Personal data that has been de-identified, encrypted or pseudonymised but can be used to re-identify a person remains personal data and falls within the scope of the GDPR.

    You have chosen the right license if your dataset cannot be accessed yet due to unpublished papers or an ongoing project. Be aware: EASY only allows for this option if you have a good reason.

<!-- ======================================= Interoperable  ======================================= -->

<div id="I-i-contents">
    When you deposit your data and you want other researchers to reuse your data, it is important that your data can be integrated in other data(sets).
    You have to make your data interoperable so it can interoperate with other applications, storage, processing or workflows for analysis.
    The following actions will improve the interoperability of your data:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Using standardized controlled vocabularies, taxonomies and/or ontologies both in describing your data (metadata level) als in your dataset (data level)</li>
        <li>Usage of prefered formats in your dataset</li>
        <li>Linking to other/relevant (meta)data that are online resolvable</li>
        <li>Adding contextual information to your dataset
        <ul>
            <li>Add files that explain the context of how the research was performed. You can think documentation in the form of notebooks, version logs,
                software documentation, documentation about the data collection describing the hypotheses, project history and objectives of the project.
                Documentation explaining the data collection method used such as sampling, data collection process, etc.
                And add information on access and terms of use</li>
            <li>Add documentation about the structure of the dataset, for instance an readme.txt file</li>
            <li>Add documentation about the structure of the dataset, for instance an readme.txt file</li>

<div id="I-i-1-contents">
    As we have seen under Findable, standardised controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies can increase the findability of your dataset.
    This also holds true for the interoperability of a dataset. The more you standardize your dataset by using or linking to vocabularies, taxonomies and ontologies,
    the better machines can interpret your data. That means that it will be much easier for a researcher to use your dataset and add it to their dataset manually or
    completely automatically, without using complicated functions and/or algorithms for translating and transferring your dataset.
</div>

<div id="I-i-2-contents">
    Preferred formats not only give a higher certainty that your data can be read and used in the future, they will also help to increase the reusability and interoperability.
    Preferred formats are widely used and supported by most software and tools researchers use. When you use preferred formats,
    your data usually can be loaded directly into the software and tools used for data analysis.
    It makes it possible to easily integrate your data with other data using the same preferred format.
    The use of preferred formats will also help to transform the format to a newer format in the case a preferred format gets outdated.

<div id="I-i-3-contents">
    To increase the interoperability of your dataset, you should enrich its contextual knowledge.
    Contextual knowledge is information about how your data(set) was created and composed. You can describe the contextual knowledge by adding links
    to all other (meta)data you have used when you constructed your data. With the help of these links other researchers will know which other datasets
    are needed in order to have the complete set of your data. It is also possible that complementary information is stored somewhere else or in another dataset.
    You need to describe all these scientific links, by properly citing related datasets.
    If these datasets have a unique and <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971013-What-are-persistent-identifiers-PIDs-" target="_blank">Persistent Identifier</a> use it to link them.
</div>

<div id="I-i-4-contents">
    Interoperable datasets also mean understandable datasets. Therefore it is essential to add context or contextual knowledge to your dataset by adding meaningful links to relevant resources.
    For instance, you should specify if your dataset builds on any other dataset or whether other, external datasets are needed to complete your dataset.
    If present, use <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006971013-What-are-persistent-identifiers-PIDs-" target="_blank">Persistent Identifiers</a>  (see Findable) when describing the context of your dataset.

<div id="I-i-5-contents">
    Complementary information about your dataset can be stored in multiple other datasets.

<!-- ======================================= Reusable  ======================================= -->

<div id="R-i-contents">
    The ultimate goal in making data FAIR is to foster reusability. Whether or not datasets are reusable by other researchers is dependent on a number of aspects.
    One of the preconditions is that the dataset has a usage license which clarifies under which circumstances the data may be reused.
    Because of the importance of this aspect, the question about the licenses, which you already answered under Accessible, is repeated here.
    In order to gain insight into the process of data generation, it is important to describe the data and metadata as detailed as possible.
    Think of questions like Under which circumstances did I / we collect the data? Where does the data come from? Moreover, similar to aspects in Findable,
    Accessible and Interoperable, it is important that you meet the standards in your discipline when describing your data and metadata.
</div>

<div id="R-i-1-contents">
    To let other researchers make use of your dataset, it is essential to explain the origin of your data and what steps you have taken to produce the dataset.
    Therefore it is very important to provide provenance information with your dataset.
    This provenance information can consist of for instance the description of the origin of the data;
    How did you collect your data, did you reuse other data? In that case add the right citations to your dataset.
    Or did you create your own data? Describe the workflow for the data creation and describe the processing of the data.
    If you have used any versioning in your data, add this versioning information to your dataset.
</div>

<div id="R-i-2-contents">
    You already answered this question under Accessible. Nevertheless, we consider it important that choosing the right usage license is highlighted under Reusable,
    too, as it is one of the key elements the may or may not allow other researchers to reuse a dataset. On the EASY page where detailed information is provided about
    how the data should be deposited (“<a href="https://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/services/easy/information-about-depositing-data/during-depositing" target="_blank">During depositing</a>”),
    there is a list with licenses that you can choose from. Depending on the data and on whether or not the
    data contains personal data (see question 5) you can choose:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Open Access (everyone): CC0 Waver, accessible to everyone, no login in EASY required.
            Choose this license if your dataset doesn’t contain personal data and if you are allowed to publish it openly.</li>
        <li>Open Access (registered users): accessible to registered users in accordance with the General Conditions of Use.
            Choose this license if your data doesn’t contain personal data but you would like users to identify themselves before downloading your data.</li>
        <li>Restricted Access (request permission): with your prior consent, users can view and download data in accordance with the General Conditions of Use.
            You can also impose additional conditions. Choose this license if your data contains personal data.</li>
        <li>Restricted Access (archaeology group): accessible to registered archaeologists and archaeology students in accordance with the General Conditions of Use.
            Choose this license if you are in the field of archeology.</li>
        <li>Other Access: the data will be accessible through another repository. Choose this license if your data is deposited and available in another repository.
            Contact DANS <a href="mailto:info@dans.knaw.nl">(info@dans.knaw.nl)</a> if you would like to use this license.</li>

<div id="R-i-3-contents">
    It is more likely that other researchers reuse your data if the metadata contains domain-specific standards, i.e. (meta)data has the same type,
    is organised in a standardized way, follows a commonly used or community accepted template, etc. Within different communities and domains minimal standards
    have been described but, unfortunately, not every domain has standards yet. More generic standards that you could use if there are no domain-specific standards
    are described in Question 2. Most of the standards come with instructions on how to use them.

    By opting for the CC0 Waiver you have made your data as open as possible, contributing to open science and enabling others to re-use your data. Your data will become more findable, and easier to access. CC0 is the recommended and best option to choose in order to stimulate optimal reuse of your dataset. Please note that when you have sensitive/personal data Restricted Access is required.
</div>

<div id="R-advice-2.1">
    Restricted Access is the right choice when you deal with sensitive data. However, in all other cases it is recommended to make your data as open access as possible. By doing this you contribute to open science and optimal exposure of your dataset. Make your data as open as possible and as closed as neccessary.
</div>

<div id="R-advice-2.2">
    There can be various reasons to make your data publicly accessible after an embargo period, for instance when your article has not been written or published yet. An embargo is not always the right choice however. While choosing the duration of the embargo consider that the more recent your data are the more relevant they are for other researchers. And bear in mind that after the embargo period, it is recommended to make your data as open access as possible and as closed as necessary.

<div id="R-advice-2.3">
    It is recommended to choose one of the more pronounced access categories, since they will give the re-user more specified information on how to access/request access and will increase the findability of the dataset. Other Access means that you make your data available through an other repository. Note that not all repositories are trusted or long-term. Make your data as open access as possible and as closed as necessary.

    Great job! Not only has it become easier to find your data (see the 'F'), your metadata now also meets the requirements for proper and correct reuse. This is an important step for your data to become more FAIR.
</div>

<div id="R-advice-3.1">
    You are well under way! Generic metadata standards are widely adopted. Domain standards however are much richer in vocabulary and structure and therefore serve researchers within your discipline. Did you know that you can check if your domain has got metadata standards?
</div>

<div id="R-advice-3.2">
    Good to see that your data do meet domain standards to a certain extend. FAIR data should at least contain minimal information standards. Try to look for ways to improve; the more standardized your metadata are, in other words: the more they are organized in a standardized way, the better they are suited for re-use! Always try to keep the user-perspective in eye.
