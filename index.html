                    <br>
                    <p>Welcome to the DANS FAIR Data self-assessment tool. Using this tool you will be able to assess
                        the 'FAIRness' of a dataset and determine how to enhance its FAIRness (where applicable).</p>
                    <p>
                    This self-assessment tool has been designed predominantly for data librarians and IT staff, but could be used
                    by software engineers developing FAIR Data tools and services, and researchers provided they have assistance
                    from research support staff.</p>
                    <p>
                    You will be asked questions related to the principles underpinning Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
                    Reusable. Once you have answered all the questions in each section you will be given a ‘green bar’ indicator based
                    on your answers in that section, and when all sections are completed, an overall 'FAIRness' indicator is provided.</p>
                    <p>
                    Please be aware that additional explanatory information is provided within the tool. The (i) information button
                    provides an overview of each of the FAIR high-level elements (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable).
                    Additionally, each question is hyperlinked, leading users to explanatory information and links to wider resources
                    on related topics.

<!-- ======================================= Findable  ======================================= -->

<div id="F-i-contents">
    Now that you have finished your research project, you are on the brink of depositing your research data in a trustworthy long-term repository. Findability is one of the four pillars of the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR Guiding Principles</a>. If you take care of the findability of your data, you will enable search engines to find it and possibly also link it to related sources on the web. Moreover, you will improve the exposure of your research and help researchers to find and potentially reuse your data.
    <br><br>
    Findability generally comes down to giving a proper description of your dataset.
    This description can be divided into three elements:
    <ul>
        <li>Rich and detailed metadata and additional information</li>

    Metadata is information that describes an object such as a dataset. It gives context to the research data, providing information about the URL where the dataset is stored, creator, provenance, purpose, time, geographic locations, access conditions, and terms of use of a data collection. The extent to which metadata is given for a dataset can vary greatly and has an effect on how findable a dataset is. In EASY a minimum number of metadata fields are required in order to successfully deposit a dataset. The minimum metadata, however, is not comprehensive enough to fulfil the requirements of FAIR. The following list provides a comprehensive list of items that should be covered when aiming for sufficient metadata:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>A globally unique persistent identifier e.g. a DOI (provided by EASY)</li>
        <li>A title</li>
        <li>Related people, i.e. the creator of the dataset</li>
        <li>Other related people who contributed to the dataset</li>
        <li>Date on which the dataset was completed</li>
        <li>A description of how the data were created (contextual information)</li>
        <li>Target group for the dataset deposited (i.e. scientific disciplines)</li>
        <li>Keywords that describe your data (use controlled vocabularies if available for your field)</li>
        <li>A licence that clearly states the extent to which the data is accessible (a list to choose from is given in EASY)</li>
        <li>Temporal coverage: the period of time to which the data relate</li>
        <li>Spatial coverage: Geographical location of the research area or site</li>
        <li>Related datasets, resources like publications, websites etc. (digital or analogue)</li>
        <li>File formats used in the dataset</li>
    </ul>

    ! Many of the items on this list also relate to the accessibility, interoperability and reusability of the dataset. These aspects will be dealt with in the respective sections of this tool.

<div id="F-i-2-contents">
    To make your (meta)data findable we encourage the use of controlled vocabularies, taxonomies and/or ontologies.
    <br><br>
    A <b>controlled vocabulary</b> is an organized and standardized list of terms and can be used to describe data. Controlled vocabularies are mostly discipline-specific and therefore very useful for describing your data. By using controlled vocabularies your metadata becomes much more understandable for machines and users and therefore they improve the findability of your data.
    <br><br>
    A <b>taxonomy</b> is a classification of entities in an ordered system. A taxonomy is mostly domain specific and is used to identify the content/data by adding terms from the taxonomy to the content/data description. Identifying content in a structured way gives search engines the opportunity to optimize their search functionality. In this way more relevant data can be found based on a single search query. Therefore adding taxonomy terms to your dataset description the findability of your dataset will improve.
    <br><br>
    An <b>ontology</b> is a formal description of knowledge. This knowledge is described as a set of concepts and relations between these concepts within a specific domain. Ontologies are created to organize information into data and knowledge. An ontology attempts to represent entities, ideas and events, with all their interdependent properties and relations, according to a system of categories. By applying existing ontologies to describe your data, your data becomes more understandable for machines and thus improves the findability of  your data.
    <br><br>
    From ontologies it is a small step to <b>linked open data</b>. Making use of linked open data means that your data is interlinked with other data, that your data is openly accessible and that your data can be shared within the semantic web. In this way your data is published in a structured and understandable way. Linked (open) data is described as a set of triples;  following the RDF data structure.  triple is a basic set of a subject, a predicate and an object. For example, a subject is “grass”, its corresponding predicate “has color” and the object is “green”. By linking your data to other data, more knowledge and information and links to your data becomes available. This will help to increase the findability of your data.
    <br><br>
    When you make use of standardized controlled vocabularies, taxonomies or ontologies, be aware that there are general standards, such as the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/" target="_blank">getty thesaurus</a> for geographical names, but there are also a lot of domain specific standards, that can help you in describing your dataset and increase the findability.
    <br><br>
    When you deposit data in EASY some metadata sections will offer you already (domain specific) controlled vocabularies. For instance to describe the subject and the temporal coverage  you can select term from the “Archeologisch Basis Register” (ABR) and the newer version ABRplus. These vocabularies are maintained by the Dutch “Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed”
    <br><br>
    Furthermore in EASY/DANS datavault offers standardised terms for creator and contributor, these are derived from <a href="http://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.0/include/datacite-contributorType-v4.xsd" target="_blank">DataCite</a>. To specify a Relation the standard specification of  <a href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/usageguide/qualifiers/" target="_blank">Dublin Core</a> is used. For language the ISO 639 standard is used and for date fields the ISO 8601 standard is used. And to specify the format of the dataset you can make use of <a href="https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/easy-split-multi-deposit/blob/master/src/main/assembly/dist/cfg/acceptedMediaTypes.txt" target="_blank">this</a> standardised list.

<div id="F-i-3-contents">
Additional information is information that helps users to assess the content and the relevance of the dataset they are viewing. The most important means to provide additional information is a so-called readme file in which topics like the structure of the dataset are addressed.
    Questions like how many files does the dataset contain and how are they related to each other? Which software has to be used to assess the data? How many versions of data are contained in the dataset? Help users to assess and contextualize the dataset.
    Other topics to address include but are by no means limited to methodologies used, a detailed summary of the project in which the data was collected, information about whether and how the data was cleaned, how many versions of the dataset were made etc.
    Information about the provenance and the versioning of your data, moreover, can be added in addition to the readme file.
    If you have covered most of the items on the metadata list (see explanatory text Question 1) you already provide a satisfactory amount of additional information. Nevertheless, it is important to supplement your metadata with more contextual information.
    <br><br>
    ! This question also relates to the letter R (reusability) of FAIR.

<!-- ======================================= Interoperable  ======================================= -->

<div id="I-i-contents">
    When you deposit your data and you want other researchers reuse your data it is important that your data can be integrated in other data(sets). You have to make your data interoperable so it can interoperate with other applications, storage, processing or workflows for analysis.
    To make your data interoperable you can think of:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Using standardized controlled vocabularies, taxonomies and/or ontologies both in describing your data (metadata level) als in your dataset (data level)</li>
        <li>Usage of prefered formats in your dataset</li>
        <li>Linking to other/relevant (meta)data that are online resolvable</li>
        <li>Adding contextual information to your dataset</li>
        <li>Adding scientific links between your dataset and other datasets</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div id="I-i-1-contents">
    As we have seen under Findable, standardised controlled vocabularies, taxonomies, ontologies can increase the findability of your dataset.
    However the more you standardize your dataset by using or linking to vocabularies, taxonomies and ontologies, your dataset does not only become more understandable and reusable by humans, but also machines can interpret your data.
    Therefore it is much easier for a researcher to make use of your dataset by adding your data to their dataset manually or completely automatically, without using complicated functions and/or algorithms for translating and transferring your dataset.
</div>

<div id="I-i-2-contents">
    Preferred formats not only give a higher certainty that your data can be read and used in the far future, they will also help to increase the reusability and interoperability.
    Preferred formats are widely used and supported by most software and tools researchers use.
    When you use preferred formats your data can most of the time directly loaded into the software and tools used for data analysis and it makes it possible to easily integrate your data with other data using the same preferred format.
    <br>
    The use of preferred formats will also help to transform the format to a newer format in the case a preferred format gets outdated.
</div>

<div id="I-i-3-contents">
    When you make use of interoperable data in your own research, you don’t need to integrate all the data in your dataset.
    If the data is online available and interoperable, you can simply link/refer to this data. When other researchers want to reuse your data, they will gain access via these links to all the data you have used.
</div>

<div id="I-i-4-contents">
    Interoperable datasets also mean understandable datasets. Therefore it is essential to add context or contextual knowledge to your dataset by adding meaningful links to relevant resources.
    You should specify if your dataset builds further on any other dataset or that any other external dataset is needed to complete your dataset.
    Make sure you use  persistent identifiers when describing the context of your dataset.
</div>

<div id="I-i-5-contents">
    Complementary information about your dataset can be stored in multiple other datasets. Linking to these dataset is essential to interpret and understand your dataset.

    By opting for the CC0 Waiver you have made your data as open as possible, contributing to open science and enabling others to re-use your data. Your data will become more findable, and easier to access. CC0 is the recommended and best option to choose in order to stimulate optimal reuse of your dataset. Please note that when you have sensitive/personal data Restricted Access is required.
</div>

<div id="R-advice-2.1">
    Restricted Access is the right choice when you deal with sensitive data. However, in all other cases it is recommended to make your data as open access as possible. By doing this you contribute to open science and optimal exposure of your dataset. Make your data as open as possible and as closed as neccessary.
</div>

<div id="R-advice-2.2">
    There can be various reasons to make your data publicly accessible after an embargo period, for instance when your article has not been written or published yet. An embargo is not always the right choice however. While choosing the duration of the embargo consider that the more recent your data are the more relevant they are for other researchers. And bear in mind that after the embargo period, it is recommended to make your data as open access as possible and as closed as necessary.

<div id="R-advice-2.3">
    It is recommended to choose one of the more pronounced access categories, since they will give the re-user more specified information on how to access/request access and will increase the findability of the dataset. Other Access means that you make your data available through an other repository. Note that not all repositories are trusted or long-term. Make your data as open access as possible and as closed as necessary.

    Great job! Not only has it become easier to find your data (see the 'F'), your metadata now also meets the requirements for proper and correct reuse. This is an important step for your data to become more FAIR.
</div>

<div id="R-advice-3.1">
    You are well under way! Generic metadata standards are widely adopted. Domain standards however are much richer in vocabulary and structure and therefore serve researchers within your discipline. Did you know that you can check if your domain has got metadata standards?
</div>

<div id="R-advice-3.2">
    Good to see that your data do meet domain standards to a certain extend. FAIR data should at least contain minimal information standards. Try to look for ways to improve; the more standardized your metadata are, in other words: the more they are organized in a standardized way, the better they are suited for re-use! Always try to keep the user-perspective in eye.

    FAIR data should at least contain minimal information standards. Have you checked if your domain has got metadata standards? There are multiple websites that have listed domain standards, please take a look at their websites.
