    <p>Selected datasets should be assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier (PID) so they  can be located unambiguously
        by humans or machines on the web. Persistent identifiers are maintained and governed so that they remain stable and direct
        the users to the same relevant object consistently over time. Examples of PIDs include Digital Object Identifier (DOI),
        the Handle System, identifiers.org, w3id.org and Archival Resource Key (ARK).</p>
    <p>Identifiers are normally assigned by data repositories (or other service providers) when data and/or metadata are made available
        through their services. Repositories ensure that the identifier continues to point to the same data or metadata,
        according to the specified access terms and conditions. You can search for data repositories supporting PIDs (for e.g., DOI)
        on registries such as <a href="https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&pidSystems%5B%5D=DOI" target="_blank">Re3data<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
        or <a href="https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.hFLKCn" target="_blank">FAIRsharing<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
    <p>It is worth noting here that not all data you produce during your research will need a PID.
        In general, those that underpin published findings or have longer term value are worth assigning a PID.
        If in doubt about which data should be allocated a PID, speak to your local research data management support team.</p>

    <div id="F-i-1-additional">
        <p>For example, the DOI system guarantees the persistence (and uniqueness) of its identifiers in two main ways:
            1) by applying policies that govern how organisations assign these identifiers,  and
            2) by operating the necessary technical infrastructures to ensure they continue to point to the same data or metadata,
            according to specified access terms and conditions (this is called ‘resolving’ the identifier)</p>
        <p>Persistent identifiers may point to a data file, a web service response that contains data values,
            or ideally to  an online page that contains metadata for context and the link to access the actual data or
            details about how to request access). The technical process of translating the identifier to a location
            is called ‘resolving’ an identifier.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div id="F-i-2-contents">
    <p>The necessary metadata is descriptive information about the data object (e.g. creator, title, publisher, creation and publication date,
        summary and keywords describing the data) provided by the researcher when documenting the dataset for deposit in a data repository.</p>
    <p>Since the metadata required depends on the type of users and the intended applications,
        the focus here is on ensuring the minimum descriptive information needed to enable data discovery and citation by potential users -
        even those from other domains. The metadata should include the <span data-toggle="tooltip" title="A globally unique and persistent identifier">PID</span>
        for the data so that users can discover and access the data. In cases where the data cannot be shared openly for ethical,
        legal or commercial reasons, the metadata should make clear how a potential reuser can request legitimate access.</p>
    <p><b>Data content</b><br>
        The content of the dataset should be specified in the metadata. It should be an accurate reflection of the actual data deposited.
        Examples of the properties specifying data content are: resource type (e.g., data or a collection of data), variable(s) measured
        or observed, method, data format and size. Ideally, ontological vocabularies should be used to describe data content (e.g., variable)
        to support interdisciplinary reuse.</p>
    <p><b>Linked data</b><br>
        Metadata should also include meaningful and explicit links to other kinds of research output (ideally with a PID) to increase its
        potential for reuse. A data object may be linked to its prior version, other relevant datasets, related publications,
        data source (for e.g. the instrument or sample), data creators or collectors and organization such as a funder or a host institution.</p>
    <p><b>Relevant data repositories </b><br>
        The good news is that when you deposit your data with a domain or discipline-specific repository it will likely be using common
        metadata standards. This means that when you enter the basic details about your research on deposit, your description will conform
        to standards that enable search and retrieval by users within your domain and potentially beyond your domain.
        You can search for data repositories supporting a metadata standard (for e.g., Dublin Core) in registries such as
        <a href="https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&metadataStandards%5B%5D=Dublin%20Co" target="_blank">Re3data<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
        or <a href="https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.3nx7t" target="_blank">Fairsharing<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
    <p><b>Good description of data  </b><br>
        It can pay to spend a bit more time on providing a good description rather than just providing the minimum information required
        to ensure that your data is not only findable, but can be clearly understood as well.</p>
    <p>FAIR data also needs the richer more domain-specific metadata that follows a community-endorsed standard.
        Domain or discipline-specific metadata specifications are covered under a separate assessment question.</p>

        <p>Guidelines on descriptive metadata include common data citation guidelines,

        <p>Links between data and its related entities should be explicit and meaningful, and expressed through relation types
            (for e.g. the DataCite Metadata Schema specifies relation types between research objects through the fields
            <i>RelatedIdentifier</i> and <i>RelationType</i>).</p>

    <p>This question refers to the capability to make the metadata accessible online in a standard and machine-readable format.
        Machine-readability refers to a structured format that can be read and processed by a computer.</p>
    <p><b>Advantages of machine-readable formats</b><br>
        By ensuring that the metadata describing your data deposit is machine-readable, your data deposit will be visible to
        search engines and aggregators which can improve your chances of having your data cited and reused. This capability is
        normally offered by the data repository that holds the data and makes the essential details about it available online.
        For example, some repositories expose the metadata online to allow access or harvesting through a standard protocol
        (e.g. OAI-PMH) and/or a web service. Your choice of a data repository will be critical to meet this requirement.
        You can select a repository offering such capability by searching for example in the Registry of Research Repositories
        re3data.org for repositories supporting
        <a href="https://www.re3data.org/search?query=&apis%5B%5D=OAI-PMH" target="_blank">OAI-PMH<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.</p>
    <p><b>Metadata as structured data</b><br>
        Metadata may also be exposed as structured data embedded within a web page to make it more machine-actionable.
        The schema.org standard is one approach that helps to ensure indexing by web search engines such as Google and Bing.
        This allows the <a href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com" target="_blank">Google Dataset Search<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>
        which you can use to check if data hosted by the repository of your choice is indexed.
        Dublin Core is another metadata standard that repositories use to make metadata harvestable by indexing systems.</p>

<!-- ======================================= Accessible  ======================================= -->

<div id="A-i-1-contents">
    <p>Ideally, datasets should be public domain and openly accessible without restrictions. However, there can be legitimate reasons
        not to share data such as those due to privacy protection, ethical, legal, and commercial constraints. As such, it is up to
        the researcher depositing data to be aware of what can be shared, with whom and when, and to take appropriate steps to ensure
        that the data is as open as possible and as closed as necessary.</p>
   <p><b>Data access</b><br>
       The metadata describing your dataset should include details about who can access the data as well as any possible related conditions.
       Access levels can be public, embargoed, restricted, or closed access. In some cases, you may even need to apply a variety of access
       levels to different parts of the same dataset. It is important to consider these issues early on for all datasets so that by the
       time of deposit in a repository, access levels have been clearly defined.</p>
   <p><b>Licences</b><br>
       Data should be clearly licenced so that other users can legally reuse it. Application of licences is encouraged for all kinds of
       data and access levels. Without an explicit licence, users do not have a clear sense of what can be done with your data.
       Licences can be of standard type
       (e.g., <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>)
       or bespoke licences, and rights statements which indicate the conditions under which data can be reused.</p>
    <p>It is highly recommended to use a standard, machine-readable licence such that it can be interpreted by machines and humans.
        In order to inform users about what rights they have to use a dataset, the licence information should be specified as part
        of the dataset’s metadata.</p>

    <div id="A-i-1-additional">
        <p>Access levels can be categorised as follows:</p>
        <p>Embargoed access refers to data that will be made publicly accessible – either publicly or restricted –
            at a specific date which should be specified in the metadata. For example, a researcher may release
            their data after having published their findings from the data.</p>
        <p>Restricted access refers to data that can be accessed under certain conditions (e.g. because of commercial, sensitive,
            or other confidentiality reasons or the data are only accessible via a subscription or a fee). Restricted data may be
            available to a particular group of users or after permission is granted. For restricted data, the metadata should include
            the conditions of access to the data (e.g., point of contact or instructions to access the data). In cases where access
            will need to be restricted, you should check that the repository offers the required functionality to support access requests
            before depositing with them.</p>
        <p>Closed access refers to data that is not made publicly available and for which only metadata is publicly available.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div id="A-i-2-contents">
    <p>Even if a dataset is no longer available, published references and links should always point to its metadata for
        transparency and integrity. In other words, this question is about whether the metadata will be preserved even
        when the data it describes may no longer be available. Continued access to data and metadata depends on the data
        repository preservation practices which are usually documented in the repository’s service policies or statements
        (e.g. in a preservation plan or policy).</p>
    <p>Trustworthy data repositories typically guarantee a minimum retention period. When assigning globally unique and
        persistent identifiers such as DOIs, trustworthy data repositories ensure that metadata will remain accessible even
        if the data is no longer available by providing a tombstone page displaying metadata about the removed item.</p>
    <p>The preservation of data and metadata is normally considered during data management planning.</p>
    <p><b>Sensitive data</b><br>
        If your research data is associated with consent forms (for e.g., personal data) outlining terms and conditions,
        the data you deposit with a repository may only be legally preserved for a set period of time (e.g., five years after publication)
        and then must be destroyed. In such cases, the metadata record should make clear that the data no longer exists and why it is not available.
        However, the metadata record itself should be maintained to provide a record about the research that took place.</p>
    <button id="A-i-2-more" onclick="show_additional_text('A-i-2')" >Want to know more?</button>
    <div id="A-i-2-additional">
        <p>A good tip is to consider whether you should include general statements about data destruction in the consent forms you use.
            Speak to your local research data management support and ethics teams early on to make sure you can develop consent forms
            that match your aims for longer-term data retention and sharing. If eventual data destruction is unavoidable, you will need
            to check that this can be handled by your data repository of choice.</p>

    <p>By providing provenance information about the data (e.g. sources, date, contributor, version), you enable its (re)use.

        It depends on the data type (e.g., measurement, observation, derived data, or data product) and research domains.
        For that reason, it is difficult to capture a set of finite provenance records adequate to all domains. Based on existing work,
        we suggest that the following provenance properties of data generation or collection should be supplied as part of the metadata

    <p>To ensure that your metadata can be broadly shared and understood within your research domain, it is recommended to use a

        ABCD, EML, social science: DDI, astronomy: International Virtual Observatory Alliance Technical Specifications,
        linguistics: CLARIN CMDI) and well-established domain and discipline-specific repositories supporting these community
        endorsed metadata standards.</p>
    <p><b>Relevant lists</b><br>
        Community-endorsed metadata standards are listed on metadata registries such as the

        and <a href="https://fairsharing.org/standards/" target="_blank">FAIRsharing<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a>.
        Domain and discipline-specific repositories should therefore be the preferred choice to deposit your data.

    <p><b>Exceptions</b><br>
        In contrast, other communities, including new domains, may have limited standards or standards that are under development

    <p>File formats refer to methods for encoding digital information. For example, CSV for tabular data, NetCDF for multidimensional

    <p><b>Advantages of recommended file formats</b><br>
        Data should be made available in a recommended file format that is accepted by the research community to enable data sharing and reuse,
        and by the repository to enable long-term preservation. Repositories normally have different recommended standard file formats based
        on data types (for example:

    <p>Recommended formats are widely used and supported by the most common software and tools ensuring that your data can be read in the future,
        but they will also help increase the reusability and interoperability. Using recommended preferred formats enables data to be loaded
        directly into the software and tools used for data analysis. It makes it possible to easily integrate your data with other data using
        the same format. The use of recommended preferred formats will allow migration of the format to a newer one, in case a preferred format
        becomes outdated.</p>
