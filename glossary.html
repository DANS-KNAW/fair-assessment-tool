        <div id="glossary-consent-form-contents">
            <p>According to the GDPR, the processing of personal data requires a legal basis. If consent is this basis,
                this consent needs to be documented. Consent needs to be freely given, informed, unambiguous, specific
                and by a clear affirmative action that signifies agreement to the processing of personal data.
                The consent form is the document where participants indicate their decision of consent. The consent
                form or the information letter accompanying the form should include information on the research and
                consequences of participation, as well as information on how resulting data will be processed and shared.</p>

                <li>Accessible: (meta)data should be retrievable in a variety of formats that are sensible to humans and
                    machines using persistent identifiers</li>
                <li>Interoperable: the description of (meta)data should follow community guidelines that use an open, well defined vocabulary</li>
                <li>Reusable: the description of essential, recommended, and optional metadata elements should be machine processable
                    and verifiable. Use should be easy and data should be citable to sustain data sharing and recognize the value of data</li>

                part of a file’s name by a filename extension (suffix). Conventionally, the extension is separated by a period
                from the name and contains three or four letters that identify the format.</p>
            <p>A proprietary file format is owned and copyrighted by a specific company. Open file formats are publicly available.</p>
